        <h1>7 Minutes of Terror</h1>

        <p>The 'Seven Minutes of Terror' is actually referred to the entry, descent and landing (EDL) phase of the rover as the events take place much quicker than the radio signals can reach Earth from Mars for communication.</p>

        
        <p>Over the years, NASA has sent five robotic vehicles, called rovers, to Mars. NASA distinguishes between "mission" objectives and "science" objectives. Mission objectives are related to progress in space technology and development processes. Science objectives are met by the instruments during their mission in space.

            The science instruments are chosen and designed based on the science objectives and goals. The primary goal of the Spirit and Opportunity rovers was to investigate "the history of water on Mars".</p>

        <p>As of February 2021, there have been five successful robotically operated Mars rovers, all managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory: Sojourner, Opportunity, Spirit, Curiosity, and Perseverance. On January 24, 2016, NASA reported that current studies on Mars by Curiosity and Opportunity (the latter now defunct) would be searching for evidence of ancient life.</p>
