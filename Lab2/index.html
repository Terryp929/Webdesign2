          <h3>"I prefer a Cadillac Convertible Deville."</h3>

          <p>I grew up loving the Old School Cadillac cars. Since I was a teenager I always wanted to own one.
              Finally at the age of 37 I was able to purchase one.</p>

          <p>After buying a salvaged 1970 Cadillac Convertible Deville, I had to put alot of money into restore it back to it's original condition.</p>
